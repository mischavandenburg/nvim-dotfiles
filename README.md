# Neovim

Configuration files for my preferred text editor. 

I've gone through several iterations of setups. 

After discovering [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim), I did a complete re-write again .

I'm very happy with the result, and recommend kickstart.nvim as a starting point for configuration.
